# Encapsulation

In this exercise, you'll create the classes specified in the [Exercises](#Exercises) section of this document. The unit tests you run verify that you defined the classes correctly.

## Learning objectives

After completing this exercise, you'll understand how to:

* Write code that's [loosely coupled][loose-coupling].
* Write code that appropriately hides the internal details of classes.
* Limit access to properties through the use of [access modifiers][java-access-modifiers].
* Write [derived properties][derived-properties].

## Evaluation criteria and functional requirements

* The project must not have any build errors.
* All unit tests pass as expected.
* Appropriate variable names and data types are used.
* Code is presented in a clean, organized format.
* Code is appropriately encapsulated.
* The code meets the specifications defined below.

## Getting started

* Import the `oop-with-encapsulation-exercises` project into Eclipse.
* Right-click on the project, and select the **Run As -> JUnit Test** menu option.
* Click on the **JUnit** tab to see the results of your tests and which passed or failed.
* Provide enough code until the test passes.
* Repeat until all tests are passing.

## Tips and tricks

### Focus on one test at a time

As you work on creating the classes, be sure to run the tests, and then provide enough code to pass the test. For instance, if you're working on the `HomeworkAssignment` class, provide enough code to get one of the `HomeworkAssignment` tests passing.

Focusing on getting a single test to pass at a time saves time, as this forces you to only focus on what's important for the test you're currently working on. This is commonly called **[Test Driven Development][introduction-to-test-driven-development]**, or **TDD**.

### Be mindful of your access modifiers

Remember that [access modifiers][java-access-modifiers] are a key feature of encapsulation.

### Write loosely coupled code

Keep in mind that a **loosely coupled** system is one in which each of its components has, or makes use of, little or no knowledge of the definitions of other separate components. One of your goals as a developer should be to write code that's loosely coupled.

### Don't linger too long on one problem

If you find yourself stuck on a problem more than fifteen minutes, move on to the next, and try again later. You may figure out the solution after working through another problem or two.

## Notes for all classes

- An X in the set column indicates the property must have a `set`.

## Exercises

### Step One: Implement the `HomeworkAssignment` class

#### Instance variables

| Attribute               | Data Type | Get | Set | Description                                                             |
| ----------------------- | --------- | --- | --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| earnedMarks             | int       | X   | X   | The total number of correct marks submitter received on the assignment. |
| possibleMarks           | int       | X   |     | The number of possible marks on the assignment.                         |
| submitterName           | string    | X   |     | The submitter's name for the assignment.                                |
| letterGrade _(derived)_ | string    | X   |     | The letter grade for the assignment.                                    |

**Notes**

 - `letterGrade` is a derived attribute that's calculated using `earnedMarks` and `possibleMarks`:
   - For 90% or greater, it returns "A"
   - For 80-89%, it returns "B"
   - For 70-79%, it returns "C"
   - For 60-69%, it returns "D"
   - Otherwise, it returns "F"
   - _hint_: `possibleMarks` and `earnedMarks` are `int`s. What happens when a smaller integer is divided by a larger integer?

#### Constructor

The `HomeworkAssignment` class has a single constructor. It accepts two arguments: `int possibleMarks` and `String submitterName`. Use these parameters to set the instance variables of the class.

### Step Two: Implement the `FruitTree` class

#### Instance variables

| Attribute         | Data Type | Get | Set | Description                                       |
| ----------------- | --------- | --- | --- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| typeOfFruit       | string    | X   |     | The type of fruit on the tree.                    |
| piecesOfFruitLeft | int       | X   |     | The number of remaining fruit pieces on the tree. |

#### Constructor

Create a constructor for this class that accepts two parameters: `String typeOfFruit` and `int startingPiecesOfFruit`. Use these parameters to set the instance variables of the class.

#### Methods

Create a method called `pickFruit` that accepts an `int` called `numberOfPiecesToRemove` and returns a `boolean`.
 - If there are enough pieces left on the tree, it "picks" the fruit and updates `piecesOfFruitLeft` by subtracting `numberOfPiecesToRemove` from it.
 - The method returns `true` if there were enough pieces left to pick. It returns `false` if no fruit was picked—that is, `piecesOfFruitLeft` was less than `numberOfPiecesToRemove`.

### Step Three: Implement the `Employee` class

#### Instance variables

| Attribute            | Data Type | Get | Set | Description                   |
| -------------------- | --------- | --- | --- | ----------------------------- |
| employeeId           | int       | X   |     | The employee ID.              |
| firstName            | string    | X   |     | The employee's first name.    |
| lastName             | string    | X   | X   | The employee's last name.     |
| fullName _(derived)_ | string    | X   |     | The employee's full name.     |
| department           | string    | X   | X   | The employee's department.    |
| annualSalary         | double    | X   |     | The employee's annual salary. |

**Notes**

- `fullName` is a derived attribute that returns `lastName, firstName`.

#### Constructor

Create a constructor for this class that accepts four parameters: `int employeeId`, `String firstName`, `String lastName`, and `double salary`. Use these parameters to set the instance variables of the class.

#### Methods

Create a method called `raiseSalary` that accepts a `double` called `percent` and returns `void`. The method increases the current annual salary by the percentage provided. For example, 5.5 represents 5.5%.

### Step Four: Implement the `Airplane` class

#### Instance variables

| Attribute                            | Data Type | Get | Set | Description                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | --------- | --- | --- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| planeNumber                          | string    | X   |     | The six-character plane number.                 |
| totalFirstClassSeats                 | int       | X   |     | The total number of first class seats.          |
| bookedFirstClassSeats                | int       | X   |     | The number of already booked first class seats. |
| availableFirstClassSeats _(derived)_ | int       | X   |     | The number of available first class seats.      |
| totalCoachSeats                      | int       | X   |     | The total number of coach seats.                |
| bookedCoachSeats                     | int       | X   |     | The number of already booked coach seats.       |
| availableCoachSeats _(derived)_      | int       | X   |     | The number of available coach seats.            |

**Notes**

- `availableFirstClassSeats` is a derived value calculated by subtracting `bookedFirstClassSeats` from `totalFirstClassSeats`
- `availableCoachSeats` is a derived value calculated by subtracting `bookedCoachSeats` from `totalCoachSeats`

#### Constructors

Create a constructor for this class that accepts three parameters: `String planeNumber`, `int totalFirstClassSeats`, and `int totalCoachSeats`. Use these parameters to set the properties of the class:

- `planeNumber` is the plane number assigned to the airplane.
- `totalFirstClassSeats` is the initial number of total first class seats.
- `totalCoachSeats` is the initial number of total coach seats.

#### Methods

Create a method called `reserveSeats` that returns a `boolean` and accepts two parameters: a `boolean` called `forFirstClass` and an `int` called `totalNumberOfSeats`.


- If `forFirstClass` is `true`, add `totalNumberOfSeats` to the value for `BookedFirstClassSeats`.
- If `forFirstClass` is `false`, add `totalNumberOfSeats` to the value for `BookedCoachSeats`.
- It returns `true` if there were enough seats to make the reservation, otherwise it returns `false`.


### Step Five: Implement the `Television` class

#### Instance variables

| Attribute      | Data Type | Get | Set | Description                                                            |
| -------------- | --------- | --- | --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| isOn           | boolean   | X   |     | Whether or not the TV is turned on.                                    |
| currentChannel | int       | X   |     | The value for the current channel. Channel levels go between 3 and 18. |
| currentVolume  | int       | X   |     | The current volume level.                                              |

#### Constructors

The `Television` class doesn't need a constructor. However, the instance variables need default values: a new TV is off by default. The channel is set to three and the volume level to two.

#### Methods

Create methods based on the following signatures:

```
    void turnOff()
    void turnOn()
    void changeChannel(int newChannel)
    void channelUp()
    void channelDown()
    void raiseVolume()
    void lowerVolume()
```

**Notes**

- `turnOff()` turns off the TV.
- `turnOn()` turns the TV on and also resets the channel to three and the volume level to two.
- `changeChannel(int newChannel)` changes the current channel—only if it's on—to the value of `newChannel` as long as it's between 3 and 18.
- `channelUp()` increases the current channel by one, only if it's on. If the value goes past 18, then the current channel should be set to three.
- `channelDown()` decreases the current channel by one, only if it's on. If the value goes below three, then the current channel should be set to 18.
- `raiseVolume()` increases the volume by one, only if it's on. The limit is 10.
- `lowerVolume()` decreases the volume by one, only if it's on. The limit is zero.

### Step Six: Implement the `Elevator` class

#### Instance variables

| Attribute      | Data Type | Get | Set | Description                                     |
| -------------- | --------- | --- | --- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| currentFloor   | int       | X   |     | The current floor that the elevator is on.      |
| numberOfFloors | int       | X   |     | The number of floors available to the elevator. |
| doorOpen       | boolean   | X   |     | Whether the elevator door is open or not.       |

#### Constructor

The `Elevator` class has a single constructor that accepts one parameter, `int numberOfLevels`, which indicates how many floors are available to the elevator.

Either provide a default value or set it in the constructor so new elevators start on floor one.

#### Methods

Create methods based on the following signatures:

```
    void openDoor()
    void closeDoor()
    void goUp(int desiredFloor)
    void goDown(int desiredFloor)
```

**Notes**

- `openDoor()` opens the elevator door.
- `closeDoor()` closes the elevator door.
- `goUp(int desiredFloor)` sends the elevator upward to the desired floor as long as the door isn't open. The elevator can't go past last floor.
- `goDown(int desiredFloor)` sends the elevator downward to the desired floor as long as the door isn't open. It can't go past floor one.
