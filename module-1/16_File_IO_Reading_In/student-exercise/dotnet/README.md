# File I/O - Reading

The purpose of this exercise is to provide you with the opportunity to create command line applications that can read and analyze files.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this exercise, students will understand:

* How to provide arguments to a command line application from the console.
* How to read data from a text file.
* How to create complex, interactive command line applications that are data-driven.
* How to handle file paths provided as application input.
* How to read, interpret, and resolve errors related to file I/O.

## Evaluation Criteria & Functional Requirements

Your code will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

* The project must not have any build errors.
* The expected results are returned from the application.
* Paths to the input files are not hard codedâ€”that is, you should be able to pass the path to the input file to the application.

### WordSearch

#### Part 1

Write a program that asks the user for a search string and a filesystem path for a text file. When the problem is run, it searches the file for occurrences of the search string and each time it finds a line that matches, it displays the line number and contents of the line it was found in on the console.

**NOTE**: Line numbers begin with 1.

Use the `alices_adventures_in_wonderland.txt` file for test input. **The path to the file should be specified by the user and should not be hard coded in the class.**

For instance, if you wanted to run the program from the command line, you should be able to specify the file by running the application with the command at the root of the project (the same directory this README file is in):

```
dotnet run --project WordSearch/WordSearch.csproj
What is fully qualified name of the file that should be searched?
[path-to-the-file]
What is the search word you are looking for?

1732) "Well, then," the Cat went on, "you see a dog growls when it's angry,

```

#### Part 2

Modify the WordSearch program to ask the user if the search should be case insensitive.

For example:

```
dotnet run --project WordSearch/WordSearch.csproj
What is fully qualified name of the file that should be searched?
[path-to-the-file]
What is the search word you are looking for?
Who
Should the search be case sensitive? (Y\N)

### QuizMaker (Challenge)

Create a quiz maker program that asks the user a question. The user should be presented with multiple choice answers and be allowed to specify the correct answer.

The program should read the questions from an input file during startup. The questions and answers in the file are pipe-delimited ("|") and correct answers are marked with an asterisk ("*") in the file.

For example:
```
Question-1|answer-1|answer-2|correct-answer*|answer-4
```

An example of the file might look something like this:
```
What color is the sky?|Yellow|Blue*|Green|Red
What are Cleveland's odds of winning a championship?|Not likely*|Highly likely|Fat chance|Who cares??
```

The application is started with the command `dotnet run --project QuizMaker/QuizMaker.csproj`.

**Tips**

* Create a class that can hold a quiz question, its available answers, and the correct answer.
* Try holding each quiz question in a list of quiz questions.

#### Part 1

Ask a single question to the user when the application is opened. Don't show the asterisk in the list of choices.

Example
```
Enter the fully qualified name of the file to read in for quiz questions
[path-to-quiz-file]
What color is the sky?
1. Yellow
2. Blue
3. Green
4. Red

Your answer: 2
RIGHT!
```

#### Part 2

Go through all of the available quiz questions and ask the user each one sequentially. Record how many answers they got correct and print out the total at the end.

Example
```
What color is the sky?
1. Yellow
2. Blue
3. Green
4. Red

Your answer: 1
WRONG!

What are the Cleveland Browns' odds of winning a championship?
1. Not likely
2. Highly likely
3. Fat chance
4. Who cares??

Your answer: 1
RIGHT!

You got 1 answer(s) correct out of the 2 questions asked.
```

## Getting Started

* Open the file-io-part1-exercises.sln solution in Visual Studio.
* Open the `Program.cs` file for the application you're working on.
* Provide enough code to get the program started.
* Verify your work on the command line.
* Repeat until the features have been implemented as outlined in the functional requirements.

## Tips and Tricks

* Command line applications can be a valuable asset to the teams that you work on. There will be occasions when routine tasks need to be completed with files at some scheduled intervals. Learning how to create applications that can load data into systems, provide alerts when data is not correct, or even automate other systems is an essential skill for developers to gain.
* What tasks might you be able to automate in your own life by applying the knowledge you now have about reading data from files?
* Why might it be important to allow people to pass their own file path to the applications you write? How else might you get the path without explicitly asking your customer to provide the path?
* Learning how to read errors that occur when your applications fail is an important skill to develop as an application developer. When an error occurs, reading the error details is a great way to start the discovery process for diagnosing the problems that occurred.
* The [.NET Core command line interface][.net-core-cli] is a great tool for .NET developers to learn. This tool can be used to run your applications, build and compile code, run your tests, and even create new projects. The best part of command line utilities is that they can often be automated without the need to install full versions of the software. Take some time to learn about the powerful features the [.NET Core CLI][.net-core-cli] provides.
