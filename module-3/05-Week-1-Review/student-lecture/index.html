            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>According to the National Confectioners Association, more than 35 million pounds (or 9 billion pieces)
                of candy corn will be produced this year.<p>
                    <h3>Is Candy Corn Healthy?</h3>
                    <p>Candy corn is one of the better-for-you candies of the Halloween season. It contains roughly 28
                        grams of sugar and only 140 calories per heaping handful -- and it's fat free!</p>
                    <h3>Why Corn?</h3>
                    <p>When candy corn first came out, roughly half of Americans worked on farms, and the treat was
                        designed to look like chicken feed.</p>
